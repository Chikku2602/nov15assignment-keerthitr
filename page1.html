        Usually when people introduce themselves they offer you their hand. She
        didn’t. I tried to place her in my memory. She was not a classic beauty.
        So many attractive women tend to look like so many other attractive
        women, each of them borrowing heavily from the same magazines, TV shows,
        movies, and whatever else drives what we consider fashion these days.
        Yet Riley’s face, liberally sprinkled with freckles, was as unique as
        her name, and startling ivory-colored hair cut close to her scalp
        emphasized the individuality of her looks. I suspected that half the
        people she met thought she was pretty; the other half not so much. I was
        in the first camp. On the other hand, she was maybe twenty years younger
        than me, so I immediately deposited her into the look-but-don’t-touch
        category despite the way her skirt slid up to there. If a man knows
        what’s good for him, he’ll limit his lust to women who are roughly the
        same age as he is.

        “How do you know me?” I asked. “My grandfather. He speaks of you often,
        although I’m not sure he likes you very much.” “Okay…” “McKenzie, how
        brave are you?” “How brave do I need to be?” “That doesn’t answer my
        question.” “What exactly do you want, Ms. Brodin?”

        “Hi,” she spoke aloud when she reached the end of the bar where we were
        sitting. I took a deep breath. Her perfume tinged the air with the faint
        scent of vanilla, and I was reminded of the eclairs you can get at
        Wuollet Bakery down on Grand Avenue in St. Paul. I love eclairs. Riley
        smiled brightly. “You‘re the lovely Ms. Truhler, aren’t you?” she said.
        Nina’s eyes flitted to my face and then back to the girl’s. I was
        curious as to what her response would be, but Riley cut her off before
        she could speak.

        “I apologize,” she said. 
        “That was rude of me.” “I wouldn’t say that,”  Nina told her. “That’s how my grandfather refers to you. The lovely Ms.  Truhler. He likes to hang labels on people, using adjectives to describe them. I’m his clever granddaughter. My father is that deadbeat
        son-in-law. My mother is—well, that doesn’t matter.” 
        “Who is your grandfather?”
          I asked. “Walter Muehlenhaus.”
