        I suppose that’s what Navarre was—a dreamer. But his dream was rotten at
        its core. Navarre believed that if he stole enough and lied enough to
        enough people, if he pretended hard enough, he could become the man
        Riley Brodin wanted to marry. Only it wasn’t a man Riley had been
        searching for all her young life. It was love—pure and simple. And
        that’s something that cannot be stolen or bought or faked. In the end,
        Navarre thought he had almost made his dream come true. He was mistaken.
        The truth was, he never had a chance.There were any number of different
        watercraft sharing the huge lake and I thought about Navarre’s boat, the
        So?adora, and I wondered what became of it. Did it crash and burn like
        its owner? Probably not. Probably it had been shrink-wrapped in blue
        polyethylene film and dry-docked until the next dreamer came along to
        claim it.<br>
